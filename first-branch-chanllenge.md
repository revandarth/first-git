# Creating Your First Branch Challenge

## Challenge Objectives

In this challenge, you'll demonstrate your understanding of Git branches by:

- Creating a new branch
- Making changes on that branch
- Switching back to the master branch

## Challenge Instructions

1. Initialize a new Git repository if you haven't already. You can do this by typing `git init` in your terminal.
2. Create a new file in your repository and add some content to it.
3. Stage and commit your changes.
4. Create a new branch called `feature`. You can do this by typing `git branch feature` in your terminal.
5. Switch to the `feature` branch by typing `git checkout feature`.
6. Make some changes to the file you created earlier.
7. Stage and commit these changes.
8. Switch back to the `master` branch by typing `git checkout master`.

## Challenge Verification

To verify that you've successfully completed this challenge:

1. Type `git log` in your terminal. You should only see the first commit you made.
2. Switch back to the `feature` branch and type `git log` again. You should see both commits.
