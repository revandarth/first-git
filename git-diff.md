# Working with diff

## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you'll learn:
- How to view the differences between commits using Git's `diff` command.
- How to view the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

## Viewing Differences Between Commits

To view the differences between commits, you can use the `diff` command followed by the hashes of the two commits. Here's how:

1. Type `git log` in your terminal to see a list of all commits along with their hashes.
2. Type `git diff hash1 hash2` in your terminal, replacing `hash1` and `hash2` with the hashes of the two commits you want to compare. Git will show you the differences between the two commits.

## Viewing Differences Between the Working Directory and the Staging Area

You can also use the `diff` command to view the differences between the working directory and the staging area. Here's how:

1. Type `git diff` in your terminal. Git will show you the differences between the working directory and the staging area.

## Next Steps

Now that you've learned how to work with diff, you're ready for the creating a Git log challenge. Move on to the next lab, [Creating a Git Log Challenge](git-log-challenge.md), to test your new skills.
