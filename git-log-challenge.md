# Creating a Git Log Challenge

## Challenge Objectives

In this challenge, you'll demonstrate your understanding of Git logs by:

- Making multiple commits in your repository
- Viewing the log of your commits
- Using the `--oneline`, `--stat`, and `--graph` options with the `log` command

## Challenge Instructions

1. Initialize a new Git repository if you haven't already. You can do this by typing `git init` in your terminal.
2. Create a new file in your repository and add some content to it.
3. Stage and commit your changes.
4. Make additional changes and commits, ensuring that each commit has a distinct message.
5. View the log of your commits by typing `git log` in your terminal.
6. Try using the `--oneline` option with the `log` command to view a simplified version of the log.
7. Try using the `--stat` option with the `log` command to view commit stats along with the log.
8. Try using the `--graph` option with the `log` command to view a text-based graph representing the commit history.

## Challenge Verification

To verify that you've successfully completed this challenge:

1. Type `git log --oneline` in your terminal. You should see a simplified version of the commit log.
2. Type `git log --stat` in your terminal. You should see commit stats along with the log.
3. Type `git log --graph` in your terminal. You should see a text-based graph representing the commit history.
