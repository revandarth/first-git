# Your First Git Repository

## Learning Objectives

In this lab, you'll learn:
- How to initialize a Git repository using Git's `init` command.
- What it means to create a Git repository.

## Git Fundamentals

Welcome to the first lab of our interactive set. This lab will walk you through the basics of creating your first Git repository. 

### Initializing a Git Repository

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Git repository.
3. Type `git init`. This will create a new Git repository in your current directory.

### Understanding Git Repositories

A Git repository (or "repo") is a file storage location where you keep all of your project's files and related data. When you initialize a repository with the `git init` command, Git creates a hidden directory within the repository called `.git`. This directory contains all the metadata for the repository, including commit logs, references to commit objects, and a HEAD file.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with creating a Git repository, you're ready to make your first commit. Move on to the next lab, [Your First Commit in Git](first-commit.md), to learn how.
