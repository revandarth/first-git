# Testing Your Knowledge of Git: Final Challenge

## Challenge Objectives

In this final challenge, you'll put together everything you've learned in the previous labs by:

- Creating a new Git repository
- Making and committing changes
- Creating branches and making different changes on each
- Merging changes from branches into the master branch
- Using the `diff` command to view differences between commits
- Viewing the log of your commits with different options

## Challenge Instructions

1. Initialize a new Git repository.
2. Create a new file in your repository and add some content to it.
3. Stage and commit your changes.
4. Create two new branches and make different changes on each.
5. Merge the changes from each branch into the master branch.
6. Use the `diff` command to view differences between your commits.
7. View the log of your commits, try using the `--oneline`, `--stat`, and `--graph` options with the `log` command.

## Challenge Verification

To verify that you've successfully completed this challenge:

1. Your repository should have multiple commits from different branches.
2. Using `git diff hash1 hash2`, you should be able to see differences between two commits.
3. Using `git log --oneline`, `git log --stat`, and `git log --graph`, you should be able to see a simplified version of the log, commit stats, and a text-based graph representing the commit history respectively.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on completing the final challenge! You've now practiced some of the most important Git commands and workflows. Continue practicing and exploring more advanced features of Git to enhance your skills.
